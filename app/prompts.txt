Positive Prompt:

lyco:GoodHands-beta2:0.5, high quality, masterpiece, (realistic, photo-realistic:1.2), high definition, ultra detailed, raw photo, Close-up of a magnificent tiara resting on an elegant velvet pedestal. The tiara is masterfully crafted with intricate designs and adorned with a myriad of precious gems that catch and reflect light from every angle, creating a mesmerizing sparkle. The backdrop is a softly focused, luxurious silk curtain in a subtle shade that complements the tiara’s metallic and gem tones. The lighting is expertly arranged to enhance the shimmering effects of the gems, highlighting the exquisite details of the craftsmanship. The scene is set to evoke a sense of royal elegance and timeless beauty, perfectly suited to display the tiara’s sophistication and grandeur in a captivating, regal manner.

Negative Prompt:

FastNegativeV2, (bad-artist:1.0), (loli:1.2), (worst quality, low quality:1.4), (bad_prompt_version2:0.8), bad-hands-5, lowres, ((text)), (watermark), error, cropped, worst quality, low quality, normal quality, ((username)), blurry, Close-up of a tiara clumsily placed on a cheap, plastic pedestal that mimics velvet poorly. The tiara itself lacks luster, with gems that appear dull and poorly attached, failing to sparkle or catch the light effectively. The background is a stark, unflattering piece of fabric that clashes with the tiara’s design. The lighting is harsh and improperly directed, creating glaring reflections that obscure the details of the tiara, making it look less appealing and cheap. The overall presentation is unprofessional and diminishes the perceived value and beauty of the tiara, rendering it unimpressive and undesirable.

These prompts are crafted to either magnify the allure and brilliance of the tiara or to undermine its quality and presentation, depending on the intended effect of the video generation.

          Example of a normal image description:

          Against the commanding presence of a snow-covered mountain, a group embarks on a spirited trek, pulling sleds like colorful charms against the white canvas. 
          They're rendered in Pixar's characteristic bold hues, their silhouettes etched with anticipation and the kinetic energy of an upcoming downhill race
          
          Example of a Pixar-style image description based on the given text prompt:

          In the frosty embrace of a serene, snow-laden landscape, an animated scene unfurls, vivid as a painter's dream. The backdrop is a majestic mountain, its peaks frosted with a brilliant, shimmering white, towering protectively over the valley. It's an awe-inspiring giant, painted with the soft pastels of the early morning light, which casts long, dramatic shadows and bathes the scene in a tranquil, icy blue glow. 
          At the heart of this frozen wonderland, a spirited group of adventurers brings warmth and vivacity to the cold. Each character is uniquely crafted in the quintessential Pixar style—expressive faces full of determination and joy, with eyes sparkling like stars against the crisp winter air. Their bodies are wrapped in colorful winter gear: bright reds, greens, and yellows that pop against the snowy white, making them stand out as they energetically pull their sleds.
          The sleds themselves are whimsical creations, resembling oversized toys—vivid, patterned, and quirky. One sled might be striped like a candy cane, another polka-dotted with rainbow hues, and yet another painted with playful cartoon animals. They're not just sleds; they are treasures on skis, filled with supplies and wrapped packages that hint at stories yet to unfold.
          As the group makes their way across the snow, there's a palpable sense of excitement. They are not merely walking; they are almost bouncing, their steps infused with the bouncy rhythm of a dance. The snow crunches rhythmically under their boots, and playful puffs of breath accompany their laughter, visible in the cold air like little clouds of joy.
          Above, the sky is a canvas of light, the sun a gentle, glowing orb that seems to promise new adventures. A few flakes of snow drift lazily down, catching the sunlight and glittering as they fall, adding a touch of magic to the scene.
          The mood is one of anticipation and camaraderie, as the group prepares for a downhill race that awaits. Their faces are alight with the thrill of the challenge, and their movements are filled with energetic preparation, adjusting goggles, tightening scarf knots, and giving each other encouraging pats on the back.
          This Pixar-style animated setting is a celebration of friendship, adventure, and the sheer joy of a winter day spent in good company. The motion of the scene suggests the imminent rush of excitement, the laughter and shouts that will soon echo across the valley as they race down the mountain, sleds skimming over the snow, blurring the lines between animation and the heart-pounding thrill of real life
